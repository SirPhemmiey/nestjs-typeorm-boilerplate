## Description

Personal and production-ready [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) boilierplate to kick-start a new project right off the bat! This is hooked up with PostgreSQL as the database (although configurable) and TypeORM as the ORM. Because it's a simple boilerplate, only the login endpoint is built and then you can go ahead to use it for your needs.

The goal and intention is for it to be simple and easy to use. I'll be writing up boilerplates with Knex, Sequelize, Prisma in the future. Boilerplate for MongoDB and Mongoose can be found [here](https://github.com/SirPhemmiey/nestjs-mongoose-boilerplate)
